# QUACK50 DISCORD BOT

quack50 is a Harvard CS50 inspired discord bot. This bot's purpose is to help you dubug your code, test your coding knoledge, tame wild ducks, and have your ducks quack if off(battle)! If the last bit sounds familiar, no it doesn't!

Ever since Dr. Malan showed us the duck debugger I thought it was so funny and wholesome.
There was a lecture where he showed a program that takes any string input and the program's sole purpose
in life was to just say "quack". Essentially, the goal was you used that tool to help you debug your code.
Even though, it only replies quack, it helps you think/talk through what was going on with your program.
I started off my discord bot with doing just that then I added a few silly features to it.
